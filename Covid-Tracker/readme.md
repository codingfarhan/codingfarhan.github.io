This is a simple Covid-19 Tracker that fetches the current day's Covid data of various Countries.

I have used Ajax to fetch and load data on the front-end.

The API used is: https://api.covid19api.com

You can tweak around the project, adding additional features and fun stuff as you wish.

Have Fun!
